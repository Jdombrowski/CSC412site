                        Currently a full-time Computer Science Junior at SFSU, holding a 3.7 GPA while working 
                        part-time at Blue Bottle cafe. Experience in C++, Java, Python, Unix based 
                        systems, HTML, and CSS. I'm very interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, and 
                        have a few projects involving such that I am going to be working on over this summer. 
                        These include mass coffee data analysis for Blue Bottle quality control to cut 
                        waste and maximize efficiency, personal cycling data analysis to maximize my own 
                        performance and building a website to showcase my photography.
                        <br><br>
                        I've been at Blue Bottle for nearly a year, and will be my second time going through a cafe 
                        opening at the end of May. Personal and interpersonal development, while facilitating growth 
                        in new team members. I've been creating products and environments for them to flourish in for 
                        over 4 years in the coffee industry. That's the kind of dedication and quality I intend to bring
                        with me wherever I go. 
                        <br><br>    
                        Hope to hear from you soon!
